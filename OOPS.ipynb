        "\n",
        "  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects are instances of classes and can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). The primary principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",

        "\n",
        "  A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. A class can be seen as a template that describes the structure and behavior of its objects.\n",

        "Method chaining is a programming style where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. Each method returns the object itself (typically self), so you can call another method on it.\n",
